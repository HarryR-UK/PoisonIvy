# ABOUT
A python program which can do different networking functions, such as:

`Displaying a URL as an IP address`

`A very simple port scanner`

`Russian Roulette` -- tested in a linux VM, and it can ruin your computer (have not tried Windows)

`Pinging an IP address`

`spamming through text`

# BACKGROUND

This was a slightly older program I had made, which was my first introduction of network programming.
